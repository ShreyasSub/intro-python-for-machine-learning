# Machine Learning With Scikit Learn

After a primer on modern AI and ML, we'll finally get back to the example we saw in the first class. With our expanded understanding of Python and the foundations of computer programming, students will be challenged to expand on that example by building an additional model and adding useful charts.

## Class Topics

* Revisit: What are artificial intelligence and machine learning?
* Revisit: What is supervised learning?
* Scikit-learn's API.
* Test/train/validation data splits.
* The K-nearest Neighbor algorithm.
* Exercise:
    * Modify the parameters of a K-NN model and evaluate the changing performance.
    * Use Scikit Learn to build a predictive model using a different algorithm.
