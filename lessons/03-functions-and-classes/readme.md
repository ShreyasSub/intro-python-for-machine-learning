# Functions and Classes

In Python (and most other programming languages) there are two fundamental ways to organize code into logical units: functions and classes. Reusing blocks of code and creating complex data structures both rely heavily on the existence of functions and classes. Similarly, the libraries that programmers use to execute AI and ML workloads are organized into importable functions and classes.
